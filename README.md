The Odin Project - Google Homepage

The first major exercise in the "Foundations" segment of The Odin Project. Students are tasked with recreating the Google homepage. Functionality (including hover) is not required, nor is pixel-perfect accuracy. This is an exercise in general styling and positioning of objects.
